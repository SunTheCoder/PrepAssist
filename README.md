# PrepAssist

Gave myself the challenge of solving a problem in a day. This app makes hanging frames for our exhibitions much easier and efficient. Doing the math for hanging takes most of the time in the process. This gets rid of all of that thinking and prep time. I decided to release this so that I can test it in the field and continue to add more functionality; like the ability to hang multiple groups of frames on a wall, better error handling, or a more in depth diagram/display of the layout, saving past measurements...

Javascript/React/Redux Front End

Python/Flask backend for eventual measurement/schematic saving and retrieval
